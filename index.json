	"content": "Genesys Cloud Inbound Voice While new communication channels continue to crop up, the importance of voice remains. The speed and agility of the Genesys Cloud CX™ contact center platform connects your customer engagement with the telephony option that best fits your business needs. The widest variety of voice services connectivity options in the industry gives customers unparalleled flexibility and choice. Customers can choose Genesys Cloud CX Voice (Genesys telecom) for VoIP, or use the cloud-based Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC) option. Customers can keep a carrier contract or existing PBX infrastructure, or consolidate using Genesys as a single vendor for all needs. Customers who choose Genesys Cloud CX are often attracted to the cloud technologies and microservices architecture that provide speed, stability, and agility for their business. Adopting a cloud solution for voice services is a future-proof approach—extending these same cloud benefits across a customer’s entire communications system.\n Genesys Cloud CX Voice Genesys Cloud CX Voice is an internet-based telephony service provided by Genesys that, when activated, provides public telephony access to Genesys Cloud CX services.\n  Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC) Genesys Cloud CX BYOC refers to the ability for customers to define SIP trunks between Genesys Cloud CX and third-party devices or services.\n What We Will Build Today  Queues Today we will be walking you through the creation of the backbone of your contact center. Genesys Cloud CX\u0026rsquo;s ACD engine uses a Queue based routing system with the ability to attach skills, languages and priority to the routing logic. We will keep it simple and start with a basic queue.\nGenesys Cloud CX queues are by default equipped for omnichannel communications. Throughout this workshop, we will be routing all media types to the same queue.\n  Telephony We will also be using Genesys Cloud CX Voice services today. As mentioned above, we give you the flexbility to either bring your own carrier or to use Genesys as the carrier. Either option within Genesys Cloud CX is easily managed and allows you to take advantage of cloud voice services that can be deployed in days with no hardware required. The only steps that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to take today to set up Genesys Cloud CX Voice is to purchase a phone number and assign that number to a call route. Pretty simple, right? Please note that charges do incur for purchasing a phone number, although they are minimal. Refer to this document for pricing. https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/genesys-cloud-voice-pricing/\nArchitect Setting up inbound voice capabilities also requires an Architect flow. As a matter of fact, we will be importing architect flows for every media type that we will set up today. Architect is a powerful tool that is a part of Genesys Cloud CX.\nArchitect is an easy-to-learn drag and drop web-based design tool that creates flows for media types. Architect uses menus and straight-to-queue logic most often associated with traditional auto-attendants. However, it also incorporates advanced, feature-rich logical operations such as non-menu digit collection, External Data Access (data dips), conditional logic, and expression editing to help develop the IVR functionality. Architect also provides centralized prompt management with multi-language support.\nArchitect also has an export and import option, a feature that is important for today\u0026rsquo;s workshop. What this will allow us to do is to simply give you a downloadable file for an architect flow and then you can simply import that file into your architect flow in your instance of Genesys Cloud CX. Architect is a powerful tool and it\u0026rsquo;s very fun to learn how to build Architect flows from scratch, but it is not the objective in today\u0026rsquo;s workshop. We will save that for another day!\n Follow along  Create a new queue following and name it \u0026ldquo;G Ride\u0026rdquo; (It is important to follow the naming convention because it will affect later steps)    Add yourself as a member of the queue    Purchase a phone number for voice (Note the number you purchased, because it is difficult to find after purchase)  Go back into the G Ride queue and add an outbound calling number with the number you purchased for voice  Please navigate Here and download the flow outlined in the screenshot below. Follow attached instructions to download a sample flow   Navigate to \u0026ldquo;Architect\u0026rdquo; on the Admin screen as demonstrated below and follow the instructions to upload an Inbound Call Flow.   Once you have imported the flow, select \u0026ldquo;Transfer to ACD\u0026rdquo;, select your \u0026ldquo;G Ride\u0026rdquo; queue or whichever queue you have created, and check the box next to \u0026ldquo;DTMF goes to this menu choice from any menu\u0026rdquo;. Please see screenshot below for guidance   Delete the \u0026ldquo;Transfer to User\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dial by Extension\u0026rdquo; tasks by following the screenshot below. When you have finished these changes, ensure you select \u0026ldquo;Publish\u0026rdquo; Set up a call route following these instructions (use the phone number that you purchased in step two and the Architect flow that you imported in step 4)   "

	"content": "Voice Interaction Tools Hello! You are about to embark on an interaction taking journey for G-Ride as an agent named Veronica. You\u0026rsquo;ve completed the previous modules and are now ready to start taking inbound interactions. As noted above, please ensure you have answered a voice interaction and it is sitting on your interaction panel as seen in the picture below. Genesys Cloud makes it easy for you to do your job by providing you tools that give you omnichannel visibilty and allow you to take interactions quickly and efficiently. Let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nDialpad- The dialpad allows you to enter numbers that automated call systems recognize, such as an account number or a menu selection. For example, Betty the customer is calling in and needs help finding her account number and entering it into the system.\nMute/Unmute- After helping Betty locate her account number, you have to put her on mute to quickly to ask the agent next to you for some help. The mute button allows you to ask your fellow agent a question without Betty hearing.\nPause- Looks like your fellow agent can\u0026rsquo;t help you find your information so you can hit the \u0026ldquo;pause\u0026rdquo; button to put Betty on hold while you quickly call your manager to get her input. The hold button allows Betty to hear some calming music while you get that information quickly.\nIn this scenario you don\u0026rsquo;t have to actually transfer Betty, but its helpful to know the different types of transfers and how they work.\nBlind Transfer- The blind transfer button allows you to transfer Betty quickly to another queue or agent. You\u0026rsquo;re able to see an agent\u0026rsquo;s availability beforehand. This scenario would be helfpul if it is a simple inquiry and the other agent doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know any information before the transfer happens.\nConsult Transfer-The consult transfer button allows you to check an agent\u0026rsquo;s availbility beforehand to ensure someone will be available to answer Betty\u0026rsquo;s trasnfer.You can brief the agent quickly before Betty is transferred to ensure they have the appropriate information and don\u0026rsquo;t have to waste time or ask duplicate questions.\nStart/End Secure Pause- As an agent for G-Ride, you frequently have to take personal and confidential information. You\u0026rsquo;re able to hit the \u0026ldquo;secure pause\u0026rdquo; in order to stop the recording of the call, input the credit card number, and end the \u0026ldquo;secure pause\u0026rdquo; to resume the recording. This ensures no confidential information is recorded. You can still hear the customer and speak to them during this secure pause, but the system does not record the interaction at this time. This secure pause can also be embedded in the script, which we will discuss later. Secure pauses can also be triggered through APIs and 3rd parties. https://appfoundry.genesys.com/filter/genesyscloud\nHang-up- When you\u0026rsquo;re finished helping Betty, you can hit this button to end the call and begin your after-call work.\nScript- Scripts are a way for supervisors to give you words and logic to follow when taking interactions. Scripts can contain the exact words you are supposed to say when speaking to a customer, 3rd party websites you frequently have to visit, customer data from a 3rd party system, and more! This is useful for newer agents who may not know what to say when taking a call or even for experienced agents to reference, and it saves time by having the most important tools on the same page. Scripts are completely customizable and configurable by queue and interaction type. Below is an example of what a script can look like!\nLegal Disclaimer- In some industries, agents have to say statements verbatim in order to ensure they are following compliance regulations. Agents can pop over to the statement and easily navigate back to the script.\nScreen Pop- Betty is actually calling to check up on the her package. The \u0026ldquo;screen pop\u0026rdquo; button allows you quickly open Fedex\u0026rsquo;s page to check the status of her package. External websites can also be embedded in this script depending on the administrator\u0026rsquo;s preference.\nUpdate Info-Agents can update the customer record. In this example, the system is doing a data dip and populating the CRM customer record. For example, Betty Suarez calls in and tells you she moved to Dallas and doesn\u0026rsquo;t live in Austin anymore. You can easily update this information and it will update the CRM customer record.\nSecure Flow- Similar to the \u0026ldquo;secure pause\u0026rdquo; from previously, you can process confidential personal information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, etc. The \u0026ldquo;secure flow\u0026rdquo; button differs from a secure pause in that the \u0026ldquo;secure flow\u0026rdquo; button is setup so that an agent is not able to take any confidential information unless this button has been selected. This button automatically stops/resumes the recording accordingly. Embedding this button in the script allows administrators to remove the \u0026ldquo;human error\u0026rdquo; possibility and ensure a call is recorded at the appropriate times. This allows you as an agent to focus on providing an exceptional customer experience instead of worrying about remembering to resume the recording\nCRM Data- To give a personalized customer experience, it is useful to see Betty\u0026rsquo;s information. Scripts allow administrators to present data from external systems such as CRMs. In this case, the system is doing a data dip into the 3rd party CRM to present relevant information to you. You are able to see her full name, her city, and more relevant account information. As noted above, it is a bi-directional integration so you can update information and send it back to the CRM.\nAccount-Agents are given more insight into a customer\u0026rsquo;s account and service\nScreen Share- A screen share allows you to see the customer\u0026rsquo;s screen in real-time, with their permission of course. Agents have to request and receive permimssion from a customer to initiate a screen chat. For voice, you can verbally communicate the security key to Betty, who will then type that number into a form on your website. For web chat, Genesys Cloud shares the security key behind the scenes, with no action needed you. A screen share is always linked to the original interaction, in this case a voice interaction. For quality management purposes, this interaction will show as one singular interaction.\nAgent Assist-Agent Assist provides real-time transcription of a customer call and knowledge suggestions that update automatically based on the context of the conversation. Knowledge suggestions include FAQ or knowledge article recommendations that make agents more efficient and knowledgable. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to waste time searching for information and can focus on your discussons with customers. In this example, Betty stated she wanted to change her address. Agent assist suggested a relevant article with a 97% confident rating and you can give feedback on whether this article was helpful or not.\nProfile- The customer profiles gives more information about the customer. You can see more customer details and notes that other agents have made about this customer. Its always best to have as much information as possible about the customer to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re delivering a personalized experience. For example, if previous agents have left notes about Betty frequently losing her account number, you can offer to text or email the account number so she has a copy of it.\nNotes- As mentioned previously, notes offer a way to add personalized tidbits about a customer. For example, if Betty always mentions her pet cat, Igor, everytime she calls, you can leave a note so the next agent remembers to ask her how Igor is doing. Though this seems like a small detail, it will go a long way towards making Betty feel valued as an individual customer.\nSchedule a Callback- If you are not able to assist Betty at this moment, you can schedule a callback. You can allow Betty to select a time and date that works best for her. If you are available it will route the callback to you or it will go back to the original queue. Allowing Betty the freedom to select the callback ensures you are contacting their customer at the right time.\nWrap-up Codes-Once the call has been concluded and Betty has left as a very satisfied customer, the after-call work begins. Part of your after-call work is designating a wrap-up code to give insight into the purpose of the call. For example, since Betty was calling to reschedule her appointment, you would select the \u0026ldquo;reschedule\u0026rdquo; wrap-up code. These codes give supervisors insight into calls for reporting purposes.\nYou have now concluded your first voice interaction! With the help of Genesys Cloud you were able to provide a personalized and efficient experience. Your customer, Betty, has left the call feeling satisifed with your customer service and with G-Ride. Experiences like this are how you build brand loyalty. Now on to the next interaction\u0026hellip; "

	"content": "Genesys Cloud SMS Customers often want to contact businesses in the same way they would contact friends and family. SMS allows for a more convienent, asynchronous mode of communication. Using SMS, customers can avoid calling and waiting on hold for an available agent. SMS also allows customers to engage \u0026ldquo;on the go\u0026rdquo; without a dedicated mobile app. Also, because customers engage by SMS at faster rates than any other messaging channel, the organization can resolve issues more quickly.\nSMS interactions are routed by the same orchestration engine as other media types in Genesys Cloud CX, and that is through Architect. Architect allows you to perform data dips, engage with Bots, attach routing logic and much more.\nWith agents communicating via SMS, the agent can keep the message open and use SMS like a chat channel, or close the SMS message after replying. If the agent keeps the conversation open, the system immediately displays each customer response to the agent, using SMS messages as a chat channel. If the agent closes the conversation but the customer replies within 72 hours, the conversation reopens (after 72 hours, the system creates a new conversation) and routes to the last agent that handled the SMS. If that agent is unavailable, the system routes the message by ACD to the next available agent.\nWhat We Will Build Today Today, we\u0026rsquo;ll set up the basics of SMS in Genesys Cloud CX.

Configured routing and evaluation methods help to determine the best available agent to handle the interaction.\nWhen an agent handles an email interaction, it\u0026rsquo;ll route to them like any other digital channel. Once they reply, the interaction will be cleared from their interaction panel. However, it is common that email communication may have multiple replies needing to go to the customer. Because of this, when a customer replies back to the email, Genesys Cloud CX will route to the agent who was the responder for seamless communication as long as that agent is available.\nWhat We Will Build Today Today, we\u0026rsquo;ll set up a email domain within Genesys Cloud CX that routes automatically to a queue. Email domains have the option to either route straight to a queue or to an architect flow for additional processing. You might want your email domain to route to an architect flow if you wanted to do automatic responses, data dips or attach skills to the email. For our scenario, we\u0026rsquo;ll just have the email go straight into the G Ride queue that we configured earlier.\nFollow Along   Follow the steps at this link to set up aninbound email domain - https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/register-domain-redirect-inbound-messages/\n For todays workshop, be sure to route to a queue instead of a flow as outlined in this screenshot.    Go back into the G Ride queue and update the outbound email address to the email domain you just set up.\n  Update your utilization settings to match the screenshot below. This will allow us to handle all the media types we just set up simultaneously as an agent.\n  "

Navigate to the admin page and search for \u0026ldquo;Email.\u0026rdquo; Then click into the domain you created and find the email address that you created earlier.
