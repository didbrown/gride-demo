This turns the user\u0026rsquo;s status to on-queue and available for routing interactions in all queues that the user is active in.\n  Step Two: You need to do two things to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re ready to start receiving interactions:\nGo to the user profile in the top left corner, and verify: (1) you have a phone/endpoint selected (this will typically be webRTC) and (2) hit the activate queues button and ensure you\u0026rsquo;re activated in the queue you created. Please reference the picture below.\n  Step Three: Move to the interaction screen and we\u0026rsquo;re ready to start walking through the scenarios.\n  "

If set up appropriately, it will route directly to the \u0026ldquo;G Ride\u0026rdquo; Queue and to your user in the Agent Interface. Once routed, accept.\n  It\u0026rsquo;s time to route a chat. This will eventually be replaced with a web messaging option in this workshop. You must login in using your GC CX credentials or be. Go to the Developer Tools Website and reference the Chat Tool linked here. It should look like the example below:\nChoose the \u0026ldquo;G Ride\u0026rdquo; chat deployment and queue that you created earlier. Fill out the chat data (which is optional). When ready, hit the start chat icon at the bottom of the page. It should create a chat interaction that routes into queue if configured correctly. If on-queue and utilization is configured appropriately, it will be routed to you as an agent. Hit accept.\n  Start walking through the interface as an agent, toggling through the interaction tools listed at the top:\nYou will see similarities in the interaction tools throughout all interaction types, with voice being the only channel with different options. Once comfortable, move to the agent tools on the right side of the screen.\nEnsure you\u0026rsquo;re in the chat interaction, but canned responses work in all digital channels. Click specifically on the canned response section. Find the folder that you created, search for the response and click the button to add it as a response. Once you have proofread, hit send. For further information on canned responses and managing libraries, reference this link.\n  Once you have successfully moved through the digital interactions and the tools associated, it\u0026rsquo;s time to move into the next scenario. Please stay connected to the email and chat interactions. You have now completed the scenario.\n  "

	"content": "Welcome By the end of this section you should have a fully operational omnichannel contact center. Inbound voice, SMS, chat and email will be routed to your user and you will be able to accept and answer interactions.\n This workshop is focused on teaching the team how to test the following interaction channels: voice, chat, email and SMS to ensure they are being routed correctly. User should already have completed previous module.\n Test an Incoming Voice Interaction  The first step in testing a voice interaction is ensuring you have the correct inbound voice number to dial. Navigate to the admin page and search for \u0026ldquo;DID\u0026rdquo; and click \u0026ldquo;DID Numbers\u0026rdquo;  Navigate to the DID number that is assigned to your inbound flow and save that number to your personal device  Navigate to the Interactions pane on the left side of the screen and ensure you are set to \u0026ldquo;On-Queue\u0026rdquo; (found at top right of screen)  Dial the DID number from a personal phone and select \u0026ldquo;answer\u0026rdquo; when the interaction comes through  Test an SMS Interaction  The first step in testing an SMS interaction is ensuring you have the correct number.

	"content": "Scenario   Call the phone number purchased earlier that\u0026rsquo;s tied to the call flow uploaded. In the IVR, you will hear the prompt and then be routed to queue. If your user is on-queue, the interaction will be routed to you and interrupt the digital interactions.\nNOTE: If you\u0026rsquo;re calling from the phone number listed on your user profile, the interaction will not route to you. Please ensure that the ANI you\u0026rsquo;re calling from is separate than the primary voice number listed in GCCX.\n  Accept the voice interaction as outlined in the example below. If you don\u0026rsquo;t accept before being timed-out and moved to not-responding status, change your status back to on-queue and the interaction will be routed back to you. Once you have accepted the interaction, you should have three interactions, with voice being the top option due to priority.\n  Walk through the call controls showcased at the top of the screen. Then, move to the agent tools on the right side, specifically, the Notes section. Add a note to the interaction that says, \u0026ldquo;Requested transfer to another agent. Have already authenticated, you\u0026rsquo;re speaking with Veronica.\u0026rdquo;\nOnce the note has been completed, move back to the call controls and access the Consult Transfer option. Search for a specific user within your organization, but do not transfer. Then, search for the \u0026ldquo;G Ride\u0026rdquo; queue that was created for this workshop. Transfer the interaction to that queue.\nIf you are the only agent available in this queue, the interaction will route back to you. Accept the interaction and located the notes. There should be an orange dot highlighting that a note has been passed with this interaction. Verify and read the notes.\nKeep You have now completed the scenario.\n  "

	"content": "Manual Outbound Interactions   You now have, at least, two-three interactions connected, and you\u0026rsquo;re learning the basics of an omnichannel experience. We\u0026rsquo;re going to throw one more interaction type into the mix. On the phone call, the customer requests that the contact center agent sends out a text message with specific information, such as a retail address, for them to quickly access.\n  To complete this request, you need to go into the interaction pane and next to the conversations heading, there will be a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon next to a human outline.This icon allows an agent to start a new call or [email on behalf of a queue with a customer. We also have another option to effortlessly start interactions too.\n  When you click the plus icon, you will be presented with options to start a new conversation:\nClick \u0026ldquo;Send Message,\u0026rdquo; choose the \u0026ldquo;G Ride\u0026rdquo; Queue and add input the ten-digit phone number that you\u0026rsquo;d like to text. You should pull the same Ani that is being used on the voice call, if possible. When ready, hit the green icon to start the SMS interaction.\n  Either input manually a message to send out or utilize another canned response. When finished, close out and end the interactions (part of the interaction tools). Each one will prompt you for the appropriate after-call work and wrap-up that you created.\n  Once you have completed this, you have finished the scenario and module and have successfully learned the basics of the Genesys Cloud CX Omnichannel Agent Interaction Experience.\nTo note, this is just the introduction of the Genesys Cloud CX Interactions. There are more interaction types such as social media and third-party interactions that we have not covered.
