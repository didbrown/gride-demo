      <description>Preparation   Step One: Go to the top right corner of the Genesys Cloud CX application (either browser or desktop) and toggle the on-queue switch to on. This turns the user&amp;rsquo;s status to on-queue and available for routing interactions in all queues that the user is active in.
  Step Two: You need to do two things to ensure you&amp;rsquo;re ready to start receiving interactions:
Go to the user profile in the top left corner, and verify: (1) you have a phone/endpoint selected (this will typically be webRTC) and (2) hit the activate queues button and ensure you&amp;rsquo;re activated in the queue you created.</description>

      <description>Digital Interactions The purpose of this scenario is to showcase utilization and how we can manage an omnichannel approach.
  If not already on-queue, toggle the on-queue switch so that your status is &amp;ldquo;on-queue.&amp;rdquo; From here, we&amp;rsquo;re going to trigger two interaction types - email, and chat.
  Send an email to the email address domain you created within the Genesys Cloud CX admin panel. If set up appropriately, it will route directly to the &amp;ldquo;G Ride&amp;rdquo; Queue and to your user in the Agent Interface.</description>

      <description>Voice Interaction   Call the phone number purchased earlier that&amp;rsquo;s tied to the call flow uploaded. In the IVR, you will hear the prompt and then be routed to queue. If your user is on-queue, the interaction will be routed to you and interrupt the digital interactions.
NOTE: If you&amp;rsquo;re calling from the phone number listed on your user profile, the interaction will not route to you. Please ensure that the ANI you&amp;rsquo;re calling from is separate than the primary voice number listed in GCCX.</description>

      <title>Omnichannel Experience</title>

      <description>Manual Outbound Interactions   You now have, at least, two-three interactions connected, and you&amp;rsquo;re learning the basics of an omnichannel experience. We&amp;rsquo;re going to throw one more interaction type into the mix. On the phone call, the customer requests that the contact center agent sends out a text message with specific information, such as a retail address, for them to quickly access.
  To complete this request, you need to go into the interaction pane and next to the conversations heading, there will be a &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; icon next to a human outline.</description>
